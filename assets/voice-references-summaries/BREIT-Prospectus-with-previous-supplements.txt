Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (BREIT) is a non-listed, perpetual life real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in stabilized, income-generating commercial real estate in the United States and, to a lesser extent, outside the U.S. BREIT also invests in real estate debt. As of September 30, 2024, BREIT had a diverse portfolio of 4,675 properties and 63,688 single-family rental homes, with a total fair value of $118.2 billion. The portfolio is concentrated in growth markets and includes a variety of property types such as rental housing, industrial, data centers, and net lease properties.

BREIT operates in nine reportable segments: Rental Housing, Industrial, Net Lease, Office, Hospitality, Retail, Data Centers, Self Storage, and Investments in Real Estate Debt. The company's investment strategy focuses on acquiring and managing a diversified portfolio of real estate assets to generate stable income and long-term capital appreciation. BREIT is externally managed by BX REIT Advisors L.L.C., part of the real estate group of Blackstone, a leading global investment manager.

The company's financial performance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, showed a net loss of $1.36 billion, compared to a net income of $533.1 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily due to an increase in net interest expense, a decrease in net gains on dispositions of real estate, and an increase in impairments of investments in real estate. However, BREIT's Same Property NOI, a non-GAAP measure of property operating results, increased by 4% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.

BREIT's liquidity position as of November 7, 2024, was strong, with $6.9 billion of liquidity, including $5.1 billion available under undrawn revolving credit facilities and $1.8 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. The company also expects to receive $0.3 billion of proceeds from dispositions under contract. BREIT's leverage ratio was 49% as of September 30, 2024, indicating a moderate level of debt relative to its assets.

BREIT offers multiple classes of shares, each with different upfront selling commissions and ongoing shareholder servicing fees. The company has a continuous public offering and a distribution reinvestment plan, allowing investors to purchase or reinvest in BREIT shares on a monthly basis. As of September 30, 2024, BREIT had received cumulative net proceeds of $77.2 billion from the sale of its common stock and units of BREIT Operating Partnership (BREIT OP).

In summary, Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. is a well-diversified real estate investment trust with a strong focus on income-generating properties. Despite a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the company showed an increase in Same Property NOI and maintained a strong liquidity position. With a continuous public offering and a variety of share classes, BREIT provides investors with multiple opportunities to invest in its portfolio of real estate assets.
