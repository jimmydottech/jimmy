The document is a comprehensive study of George Soros' trading methods by George Coyle. It debunks the myth of Soros' infallibility, highlighting that his success stems from his ability to take losses effectively rather than from making accurate predictions. Soros is described as a trend follower who often invests first and investigates later, emphasizing the importance of taking small losses to prevent larger ones. His trading approach is influenced by his philosophy of reflexivity, which acknowledges the imperfect understanding of market participants and the dynamic interaction between perception and reality. Soros' Boom/Bust model outlines an eight-stage process of market cycles, which he uses to identify potential investment opportunities.

The study also reveals that Soros does not spend excessive time formulating investment ideas, instead focusing on the essentials and being willing to cut losses when a trade goes wrong. He is known for his ability to bet big when the timing is right, but always with risk management in mind. Soros' self-assessment of his best skill is being a great loss taker, and he attributes his financial success to his ability to correct mistakes. The document concludes with a set of principles that can be derived from Soros' approach, including accepting human fallibility, developing a thesis, taking small positions to test the market, and constantly reevaluating one's position based on market feedback.

Additionally, the document provides insights into Soros' personal characteristics, such as his reliance on instinct and his use of a 'backache' as a metaphor for an early warning sign to exit a position. It also includes a list of sources and references for further reading and study. The author, George Coyle, is the founder of Triangulated Research, which produces a weekly newsletter using a similar 'triangulation' method to identify secular trends.
