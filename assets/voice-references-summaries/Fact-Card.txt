Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (BREIT) is a perpetual life, institutional-quality real estate investment platform offered by Blackstone, the world's largest owner of commercial real estate. As of November 30, 2024, BREIT had a net asset value (NAV) of $55 billion and a 9.7% Class I inception to date annualized return. The platform boasts a 94% occupancy rate and offers various share classes with different fee structures.

BREIT has delivered strong long-term returns and compelling distributions since inception. A significant portion of its distributions (85% in 2023) was classified as Return of Capital (ROC), allowing investors to defer taxes. The platform's performance is measured against various share classes, with Class I showing a 9.7% annualized return from inception. The platform's investment strategy is concentrated in growth markets, with 87% of its portfolio in Rental Housing, Industrial, and Data Centers.

BREIT's investment allocation is heavily concentrated in Rental Housing (22% multifamily, 10% student housing, 9% single family rental housing, 9% affordable housing), Industrial (25%), and Data Centers (12%). The platform also invests in other sectors such as Student Housing, Single Family Rental Housing, Net Lease, Office, Hospitality, Retail, and Self Storage. Geographically, 67% of BREIT's investments are concentrated in the Sunbelt region of the U.S.

BREIT was established in January 2017 as a non-listed, perpetual-life REIT. It offers monthly subscriptions and distributions, with monthly liquidity. The platform reports taxes on Form 1099-DIV. The leverage ratio as of November 30, 2024, was 49%, and the total asset value (TAV) was $107 billion.

BREIT charges different fees for different share classes. Class I shares are available through fee-based programs and institutional accounts with no upfront selling commissions. Class D, Class S, and Class T shares are available through transactional/brokerage accounts with varying upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. Ongoing shareholder servicing fees also vary by share class.

BREIT's NAV and NAV-based calculations involve significant professional judgment. The NAV is generally equal to the fair value of assets less outstanding liabilities, calculated according to valuation guidelines. The platform's financial data is estimated and unaudited, and past performance does not predict future returns. As of September 30, 2024, 100% of inception-to-date distributions were funded from cash flows from operations.

Investing in BREIT involves a high degree of risk. Risks include the lack of a public trading market for shares, the subjective nature of property valuations, dependence on the Adviser, and the use of leverage, which increases exposure to adverse economic factors. Additionally, there are risks associated with the concentration of investments in certain industries and geographies, competition for investment opportunities, and the impact of global and national economic conditions on operating results.

A portion of REIT ordinary income distributions may be tax-deferred due to the characterization of ordinary income as ROC. ROC distributions reduce the shareholder's tax basis and defer taxes until the stock is sold via redemption. Investors may also be subject to net investment income taxes and state income tax, which would lower the after-tax distribution rate.

This document contains forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual outcomes or results may differ materially from those indicated in such statements due to factors described in BREIT's prospectus and annual report, as well as any updated factors included in periodic filings with the SEC.
